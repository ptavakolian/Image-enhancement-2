We collected thermal images from a thigh of a mouse that has tumor by Enhanced Truncated-correlation 
Photothermal Coherence Tomography. I applyed different morphological processing methods and 
I was able to highlight the tumor and its surrounding vasculature around it. Then I mad a slice by slice 3D image of it.
