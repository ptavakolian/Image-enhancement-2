We collected thermal images from a thigh of a mouse that has tumor by Enhanced Truncated-correlation 
Photothermal Coherence Tomography. I applyed different morphological processing methods and 
I was able to highlight the tumor and its surrounding vasculature. Then I made a slice by slice 3D image of it. Watson and Github cannot provide the 3D video of the sample. However, the code works and you can try it.
